Magician's talent is no illusion

By Erin Sauder @ esauder@mysuburbanlife.com

_ When Paul Lee got his first magic kit for
Christmas at age 10, he immediately went -
to work trying to learn the tricks.

“Tt was a little difficult in the beginning,

but with practice and persistence I was able
to master the kit,” he said.

His parents, noticing his talent, began
buying him more advanced magic kits, and
soon, Lee was using his family and friends
as audiences. :

“T used to put on shows in my garage for
the neighborhood,” he said. “It kept me
going.”

These days, Lee still is wowing audia
ences through his successful Magic and
Tilusions of Paul Lee and Co., putting on
productions all over Illinois that include
magic tricks, illusions, live animals, audi-.
ence participation and musical backdrops.

- “1 don’t know if 1 was born to do (magic)
but I love it,” Lee said. “I don’t believe
there’s a better job than dene what I’m
doing.”

Lee does a few hundred shows a year,
including private events, programs for
schools and libraries, birthday : and bat
and bar mitzvah celebrations, and holiday
parties.

“The only thing I haven’t performed at
yet is a funeral,” he said.

Of the 200 shows Lee performed this

_ year, about 70 were repeat customers.

The magician and illusionist moved to

Carol Stream from Melrose Park more than

a decade ago.
“Twas looking for a new place, and 1
liked the laid-back atmosphere,” he said of

the village. “I fell in love with the area.”
